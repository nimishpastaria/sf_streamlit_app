# - Able to **absorb tasks and projects** (Eg, Collections program, ServiceNow Maintenance) so that the team can spend the time on new things (Eg, FY26 planning, MCD, EDP etc)
# - Helped offload responsibility of maintaing OTC portfolio project status updates and **monthly communication to business stakeholders**
# - Executed projects with **minimal supervision and involvement**
# - Identified people to be involved and **minimized the time to solution** (Eg, involved Bola in OD InArrears recon dashboard and leveraged another dashboard)

# - Takes **full accountability** and does not not drop the ball
# - **Not hesitant** to step outside of PMO duties. Eg, Visualized an end-to-end process flow diagram by gathering requirements from business (DMX in HRC), created UAT test scripts for CC AdHoc Batch Run, updated BRD occassionally
# - Able to understand systems and scale quickly to **contribute to design** Eg, HRC interface setup and PGP encryption - able to contribute to the design of DMX in HRC
# - Not hesitant to escalate and push when needed. Eg, Business to sign-off on the BRD (AWS OD AdHoc Pmts), IT resource constraints for AWS OD AdHoc Payments
# - **Ready to roll** whenever required. Late night and early morning (6am) calls with India team
# - Proactively looks out to increase and share knowledge. Eg, Enrolled for SnowPro to learn more about the basics of the product, helped shared information with other members of the PMO team
# - **Challenges existing ways**. Eg, iterative testing approach on Aging Dashboard, staggered deployment for dashboard, separate SIT for AWS internal and external scope of work
# - Built relationships with peope week on week and got faster responses to consolidate OTC/NPI deck data
# - Created a CheatSheet for a consolidated view of all the collections demands
# - Able to perform **value assessment** and **evaluate ROI** of the projects to justify the implementation
# - Solved business problems. How?
# - Got the business teams, Bola and BSAs together
# - Received push back from integration team but made noise and was able to get responses and commits from them later
